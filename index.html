            <h2><img src="images/emoji1.gif" alt="emoji1">&nbsp;The horrified Costco worker</h2>
            <p>At Costco my three year-old daughter was chatting up a woman in charge of a samples booth, breaking it down for her how dolls work.</p>
            <p>When they were done we continued shopping, pausing at intervals to sample the wares, and completely forgot about the samples booth lady... or so I assumed. It turns out all this time a thought had been turning over in that 3 year-old mind.</p>
            <p>After we had made the rounds and were heading toward the front of the store, my kid marched confidently ahead, stopped in front of the booth, looked up at the woman and announced her conclusion: &#8220;I don't know if you're a boy or a girl.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Before the woman had time to react, I grabbed my kid's hand and walked around the corner saying &#8220;Yeah, I think it's in aisle 5, gimme a second!&#8221; to my new imaginary friend.</p>

            <h2><img src="images/emoji2.gif" alt="emoji2">&nbsp;The unconscious samples guy</h2>
            <p>I begin with a haiku:</p>
            <blockquote>Costco samples man<br />
            Fallen... EMTs assist<br />
            Hungry shoppers torn
            </blockquote>
            <p>True Story. The guy was old, but he was attended to, and everyone gathered around looked very concerned (or opportunistic, it's hard to tell those apart). Anyway, you might be wondering how it all ended. Well, let's just say I got a few extra pigs-in-a-blanket that day. It's good when people come together.</p>

            <h2><img src="images/emoji3.gif" alt="emoji3">&nbsp;The fast car</h2>            
            <p>Some people get mad when a fast driver passes them. Not me. I understand that the entire point of driving is for others to <em>safely</em> and <em>quickly</em> get out of my way. And I firmly believe that the more people knew this, the happier we'd all be. So when some dude zips by me on the freeway, I just smile and nod, 'cause that guy gets it.</p>
